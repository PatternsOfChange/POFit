# Impact of Training Culture and Person-Organization Fit on Normative Feedback's Effectiveness

## Overview
This project investigates how employees' perceptions of their **training culture** and **person-organization fit (PO Fit)** influence the effectiveness of **normative feedback (NF)** on two outcomes: intention to engage in training and actual course completion.

## Key Findings
1. **Training Culture** did not significantly impact how NF influenced intentions or course completion.
   - **p = 0.358** for intention, **p = 0.233** for course completion.

2. **PO Fit** had a more substantial impact:
   - Employees with higher PO Fit were **19%** more likely to express intention to engage in training (**p = 0.019**).
   - **PO Fit enhanced the effectiveness** of NF on actual course completion by **12%** (**p = 0.006**).

### Implications for Managers:
Managers should prioritize hiring individuals who align with the company’s values (high PO Fit), as these employees are more likely to engage with training programs and benefit from feedback, ultimately improving performance and retention.

## Methodology
- **Sample Size**: 466 observations.
- **Design**: Randomized controlled trial, clustered by employee ID.
- **Tools**: Linear regression, moderation analysis.

---

## Main Findings

1. **Training Culture as a Moderator**:
   - No significant moderation effect (p = 0.358 for intention, p = 0.233 for course completion).

2. **PO Fit as a Moderator**:
   - PO Fit positively correlated with **intention** (p = 0.019) and significantly moderated course completion (p = 0.006).

---

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that **PO Fit** plays a critical role in shaping how employees respond to normative feedback. Hiring individuals who are aligned with the company’s values will lead to better training outcomes and enhanced engagement. Managers should be mindful of value alignment during the hiring process to maximize the effectiveness of feedback interventions and ensure stronger employee performance.

## Future Research Directions
1. **Explore additional moderators**: Other factors that might influence how NF affects training outcomes.
2. **Assess long-term effects**: Evaluate sustained engagement in training and its impact on performance over time.
